# Feet-Warrior
*Trigger warning: There will be feet stuff and bad jokes.*

Preface: Just wanted to make a fun project that makes me laugh everytime I think/work on it. This is all for comedy and learning, this is not meant to be a platform to make any changes to society or to shame gross weebs. All jabs are meant for fun, and not to make a stance on creepo's and creepesses. I would also like to add, I have only subed to one twitch streamer only in hopes to get a gen1 pokemon jungle booster pack. As such, I'm not well veresed in the community so I apologize if anyone is offended. 

## Overview
Being a streamer is hard enough hustling on social media to herd followers and while creating that top notch content (*chef's kiss*) 

~~Top~~ Streamers like Pokemaine, PaladinAmber, and Paymoneywubby have been plauged with fans requesting tootsie photos. Often times the requests are persistant and result in an uncomfortable interaction. Some are taking full advantage of this situation, https://thisworkfromhomelife.com/selling-feet-pics-on-onlyfans. There is no shame in making lemonade in this situation, but I aim to aid those in need.

Assuming there are ways to block keywords in streaming chats (no research) there needs to be an aid for preventing the unsolicited below ankle slip. 

This is the journey to do just that.
